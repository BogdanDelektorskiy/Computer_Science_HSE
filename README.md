I plan to upload my lecture and seminar notes, homework, and projects to this repository. Each discipline will have a separate folder, a detailed description and, of course, code files!

## first-year disciplines
- C++ contests: 10 completed contests with tasks of varying complexity
- Data analysis: 10 solved homework assignments with explanations of the written code
